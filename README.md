# Marketing Analysis

## Task Details

As a marketing analyst, your objective is to address concerns raised by the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) regarding the effectiveness of recent marketing campaigns. Your task is to analyze the dataset and propose data-driven solutions. Your analysis should be presented in a well-documented notebook with four main sections.

### Section 01: Exploratory Data Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning**: Check for null values and outliers in the dataset and describe how you plan to handle them.
2. **Variable Transformations**: Identify any variables that require transformations to improve the analysis.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Determine if there are any useful variables you can create from the given data.
4. **Data Patterns and Anomalies**: Describe any patterns or anomalies in the data and provide visualizations to support your findings.

### Section 02: Statistical Analysis
1. **Factors Affecting Store Purchases**: Use regression analysis to identify factors significantly related to the number of store purchases. Provide actionable recommendations for the CMO.
2. **US vs. Rest of the World**: Analyze whether the US performs significantly better than the rest of the world in terms of total purchases. Interpret your results in a non-technical manner.
3. **Gold Spending vs. In-Store Purchases**: Test whether people who spent an above-average amount on gold in the last 2 years have more in-store purchases. Justify or refute this statement using an appropriate statistical test.
4. **Married PhD Candidates and Fish Spending**: Investigate if "Married PhD candidates" have a significant relationship with the amount spent on fish. Identify other factors significantly related to fish spending.
5. **Regional Campaign Success**: Explore whether there is a significant relationship between geographical region and the success of a marketing campaign.

### Section 03: Data Visualization
1. **Campaign Success**: Visualize which marketing campaign is the most successful.
2. **Customer Demographics**: Create visualizations to describe the average customer's characteristics.
3. **Product Performance**: Visualize which products are performing the best.
4. **Underperforming Channels**: Use visualizations to identify which marketing channels are underperforming.

### Section 04: CMO Recommendations
Summarize your findings from Sections 01 to 03 and provide data-driven recommendations to the CMO based on your analysis. Ensure that your recommendations are actionable and aligned with marketing concepts such as targets, channels, or products.

## Evaluation
Your analysis will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. **Data Exploration**: Was the data properly cleaned and analyzed? Were there useful visualizations? Does the reader learn new techniques from your submission?
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Did you use the appropriate statistical tests, and were the results interpreted in a non-technical manner?
3. **Business Recommendations**: Are the recommendations based on your analysis in Sections 1-3? Are they data-driven and relevant to marketing concepts?
4. **Documentation**: Is your code and notebook well-documented? Are your sources cited clearly? The analysis should be concise and easy to follow for reproducibility.

Please ensure that your notebook is well-organized, and your analysis is clear and informative.
